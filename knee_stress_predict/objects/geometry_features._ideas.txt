1. To check if the cartilage is defected or not, we can project cartilage onto a plane.
Here is PyVista function how to do it:
https://docs.pyvista.org/examples/01-filter/project-plane.html

2. Then we can do two checks:
- apply the threshold to find the counter and see if there is any contour inside bigger contour
- draw a circle inside the cartilage and if the size is smaller the threshold diameter - mark it as defected
